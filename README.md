## About the project

This is the source code for the [Functor Network](https://functor.network) - a blog platform for mathematicians. The term "mathematician" here is used in a broad sense, encompassing people studying math at any level, as well as professionals in related fields. While we provide special support for mathematicians, anyone can register a blog site on our platform and express themselves on a variety of topics, whether they're related to math or not.

## Features

In one word, all features are meticulously crafted for mathematicians.

- **Effortless Typesetting:** Typesetting math on the web can be exhausting and time-consuming. However, on our platform, you can focus on your content creation and leave the typesetting to us.

- **Actual TeX Engine:** We use a real TeX engine to render your math content. This means that you are able to include LaTeX packages, use math environments, or even copy and paste your existing LaTeX document into our platform.

- **Markdown Support:** In addition to LaTeX, our platform also supports Markdown, which is a convenient format for web content. Moreover, features like cross-referencing, bibliography and theorem environments have been implemented.

- **Minimalist spirit:** Only necessary functions and features are included in our platform. This allows you to express yourself as freely as possible.


## Comparison

|           | Our platform  | Other platform |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| writing post directly in latex | supports | doesn't support |
| math-featured markdown | supports | maybe supports, but has limited features on math |
| math formula rendering | has built-in support | doesn't support or needs add-ons to support |
| keep latex code unchanged | yes | may eat backslashes, encode `<`, `&` and other math symbols |
| latex packages | supports. You can use different latex packages for each post separately | doesn't support |
| automated numbering and referencing | supports. You can use `\label{}` and `\ref{}` for this. | doesn't support or partially supports |
| custom latex commands | supports. You can define your own latex command for each post. | maybe supports |
| theorem-like environments | supports | doesn't support |
| bibliography | supports | maybe supports |
| clean and neat | Yes. Our platform is designed with minimalism in mind. It even looks a bit abstract. | may have many unnecessary functions |
| editor | provides a plain text editor with a preview window. You can focus more on the content itself rather than its appearance. | provides a WYSIWYG editor. This kind of editor may be annoying when handling math content. |
