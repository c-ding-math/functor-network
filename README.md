## About the project

This is the source code for the [Functor Network](https://www.functor.network) web platform - a blogging community for mathematicians. The term "mathematician" here is used in a broad sense, encompassing people studying math at any level, as well as professionals in related fields. While we provide special support for mathematicians, anyone can register a blog site on our platform and express themselves on a variety of topics, whether they're related to math or not.

## Features

- **Liberation from Typesetting**: Typesetting math content on a website can be a time-consuming and exhausting task. However, on our platform, you can fully concentrate on creating your content and leave the formatting to us.
- **Dual Support for LaTeX and Optimized Markdown**: We support both LaTeX and our own optimized markdown format, providing you with flexibility and ease of use.
- **Automatic Numbering and Referencing**: Mathematical discourse often involves intricate references and numbering. Our platform offers automatic numbering and referencing for your equations and theorems, saving you time and effort.
- **Bibliography Support**: We provide support for bibliography references, allowing you to easily cite relevant works in your document.
- **Latex Package Support**: Our platform supports a wide range of Latex packages, including those designed specifically for mathematical writing. This allows you to add additional functionality to your documents, without sacrificing speed or ease of use.
- **Custom LaTeX Commands**: We understand that mathematicians often require custom commands to simplify their writing. That's why we offer support for Custom Latex commands, so you can create your own shortcuts for frequently used notations.
- **Clean and Neat Design**: Our platform features a clean and neat design, making it easy to focus on your content.
- **Essential Functionality Only**: We have designed our platform to include only the most necessary features, allowing you to you express yourself as freely as possible.
